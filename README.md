Weather app location based

GOAL: To create a weather app based on location using the OpenWeather API.

To do that, several steps are needed. The tools used were HTML, CSS, JS, Jquery, Moment.js, AJAX, OpenWeather API.

I was feeling adventurous and decided to try a new (to me) framework called UIKit. It was mostly a good experience, but the fact to be learning a new tool made things take longer.
The UIKit interface is simple and I found it responsive. It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles, but what it does, it does it well. I wanted a simpler framework, that was straighforward and UIKit delivered.

The Weather Dashboard functionality is also simple and straightforward: You want to find the current weather for a given location. The dashboard offers an input field to add the city name. Just adding the name and pressing enter will give you the results, but in the case of cities with the same name in different states, there is the option to input the state in the state field.

The previous searches are stored in local storage, making it easy to search a city again without having to input the name. Just press the button with the name of the city and the current weather, along with the 5 days forecast, gets refreshed.
